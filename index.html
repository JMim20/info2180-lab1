            <h2>Jamila McGowan</h2>
            <p>I am a Black Jamaican female in STEM! A Second Year Student at the University of the West Indies, Mona, pursuing a Bsc. in Actuarial Science. Though I did not choose a major from the computing department, I have a high interest in coding, hence, my choice of doing computing electives. I chose the course INFO2180- Dynamic web development because it provides me with an opportunity outside of recreational time to learn how to code from peers and professionals. In addition to developing skills as valuable and fun as web development. </p>
